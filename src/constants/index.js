`I am a senior-2 student at faculty of Engineering, Ain Shams University. I am passionate about web development and software engineering.
I am interested in building a softwares and I am in the software product line track in my college. I started with learning the basics of the web development
which is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Then I enrolled in many trainings about the software development one of them web-based apps and then the mobile app using flutter.
Then I started to be more focused in the backend development and I started to learn the Node.js and Express.js and MongoDB, then I have learned many design patterns.
After all of this i have started learning backend development usin php and laravel in order to know many technologies and to be more flexible in the software engineering field.
 I am always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills and that will be appeared in the experience and projects section.
 I am looking for learning to many things in the software engineering field and I am looking for a job opportunity to gain experience and apply my knowledge.`;
